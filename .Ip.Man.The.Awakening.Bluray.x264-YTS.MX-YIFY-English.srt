1
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,125
Go. Go.

2
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:21,542
Hurry up.

3
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:23,833
Keep up.

4
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,291
Go down. Move.

5
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:26,208
Move.

6
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:28,083
Keep up. Faster.

7
00:01:28,292 --> 00:01:29,958
Hurry up.

8
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,041
Hurry. Move.

9
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:35,167
Get on the bridge.

10
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:37,208
Move. Fast.

11
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,375
Hurry.

12
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,792
Get down.

13
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:40,917
Get down.

14
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:43,958
Get down.

15
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:50,167
Move.

16
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,292
Move. Keep up.

17
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,333
Some are dead.

18
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,667
Mr. Stark,

19
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,792
you're bringing me so few piglets,

20
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,125
less than the previous times.

21
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,667
To make up for my losses,

22
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,332
why don't you

23
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:22,875
offer them for free this time?

24
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:36,667
The Chinese believe

25
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:39,583
that greed

26
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,208
is the bane of life,

27
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,833
and an endless desire

28
00:02:44,542 --> 00:02:46,292
is the greatest sin.

29
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,167
Don't bullshit me
with the Chinese cliche.

30
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:57,083
So, have you heard of

31
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,500
bartitsu?

32
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:01,708
Of course.

33
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:04,458
That's gymnastics in england.

34
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,207
The Chinese teachings

35
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,916
are warnings for the weak.

36
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:11,750
For me,

37
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,957
they lack imagination.

38
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,499
What nonsense!

39
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,917
I've had enough!

40
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,917
Newspapers!

41
00:04:20,917 --> 00:04:22,292
Days off!

42
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:23,042
Move.

43
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:24,416
Days off!

44
00:04:24,417 --> 00:04:25,916
Race to the queen's road.

45
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,332
Fireworks and rewards for the winners!

46
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,125
I'm certain we'll make it.

47
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,125
Ip man, hurry up.

48
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,791
I got this!

49
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:38,875
We're counting on you!

50
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,666
Sorry.

51
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:43,708
What the hell?

52
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,832
Sorry. I'm sorry.

53
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,125
Hurry up!

54
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,708
Don't worry. We'll win.

55
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,667
Don't let him win!

56
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,208
You can't win.

57
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,250
Hurry up.

58
00:05:00,251 --> 00:05:01,667
Hurry.

59
00:05:14,292 --> 00:05:15,042
Are you okay?

60
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:16,167
Wait.

61
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,667
Sorry.

62
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,542
You know kung fu?

63
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,042
Give me the bag! Do you hear me?

64
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,166
- Stop it!
- Let go!

65
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:40,457
Mom, let it be. Give it to him.

66
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,666
What are you doing?

67
00:05:41,667 --> 00:05:42,792
Give me that.

68
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,208
Sit down.

69
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:46,625
Mom.

70
00:05:47,792 --> 00:05:49,583
Mom, let go.

71
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,708
Don't move.

72
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,042
Mom.

73
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:53,875
Tell her to let go.

74
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:55,583
Just give it to him.

75
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,333
A robber in the daylight!

76
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:05,792
Let him go.

77
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,208
Bro, come on.

78
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:13,667
There you go.

79
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:29,958
Stop it there.

80
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,875
Guys, teach him a lesson.

81
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:09,750
Give me the bag.

82
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:16,833
Sorry for the trouble
we've caused you, sir.

83
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,833
Don't go.

84
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:24,917
Try again.

85
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,417
Bro, let's get him.

86
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,458
Come on.

87
00:08:34,292 --> 00:08:35,042
Hurry.

88
00:08:35,043 --> 00:08:36,917
- This station?
- Yes.

89
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,207
Is it your mom's first time in Hong Kong?

90
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,125
Yes. First time.

91
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:44,958
Run!

92
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,041
- Thief!
- Stay out of it!

93
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:48,625
Feng, thief!

94
00:08:50,292 --> 00:08:51,417
Keep an eye on my mom!

95
00:08:56,292 --> 00:08:57,375
Mom.

96
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,166
Auntie! Auntie!

97
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,792
Don't go there!

98
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:30,749
Stop it. You shouldn't kill him.

99
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,230
It's none of your business. Get lost.

100
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,457
Play with fire

101
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,917
and this is what you get.

102
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,500
Mr. Hu, mahjong again?

103
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,333
Look.

104
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:48,083
How can you
miss out on mahjong, sir?

105
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:49,500
It seems

106
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,292
you've won.

107
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,917
Stop pretending. Get up.

108
00:09:56,792 --> 00:09:59,667
Pay up to fix the problem.

109
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,082
What about my share?

110
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:05,875
That's all.

111
00:10:05,917 --> 00:10:07,667
- That's all?
- Yeah.

112
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,250
Get lost.

113
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,292
Now I've won. Dinner's on me.

114
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:23,042
Go home.

115
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,583
Go home. Go. Go.

116
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,542
Alright.

117
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,625
See you, sir.

118
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,708
- Feng.
- Mom.

119
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:34,500
Chan, are you okay?

120
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,250
This brave young man saved us.

121
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:37,333
It's nothing.

122
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:38,958
Thanks, man.

123
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:40,250
It's a small world.

124
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,250
See you around.

125
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,958
I'm feng. Mention my
name if in any trouble.

126
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,625
Excuse me.

127
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,958
Have you been to foshan?

128
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,707
Liu, what's taking you so long?

129
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,625
Coming.

130
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:56,750
Give it here.

131
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,458
Thanks.

132
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:00,292
Look at you.

133
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:04,541
Young master,
those losers deserved a good beating

134
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:07,625
for bullying the weak.

135
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,500
Let's be lenient wherever possible.

136
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,750
Alright.

137
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,417
Enjoy.

138
00:11:22,542 --> 00:11:24,542
Here you are.

139
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,333
Young master,

140
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,875
it's been eight years,

141
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,180
and you still remember my favorite dishes.

142
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
Of course.

143
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,958
What brought you here?

144
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,792
My mom needs a doctor.

145
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,083
Is she okay?

146
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,167
Same old, same old.

147
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,625
Here.

148
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,416
Young master,

149
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:52,417
that's enough.

150
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:54,167
I thought you loved spice.

151
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,541
We fed on peppers because we lacked food.

152
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:59,667
Not anymore.

153
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,792
I see.

154
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:05,208
Have you seen my daughter, cuihua?

155
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:13,917
- Okay, thank you.
- Cigarettes.

156
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,458
Sir, cigarettes?

157
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:18,792
Cigarettes.

158
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,083
Cigarettes.

159
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:26,541
It happens all the time here.

160
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:27,750
You can't help all of them.

161
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,750
Is that

162
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,250
what everyone believes?

163
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,374
Young master,

164
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:37,749
stay at my rickshaw yard tonight

165
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,208
if you're not going back to foshan.

166
00:12:39,917 --> 00:12:42,457
A friend got me this work five years ago.

167
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,874
Now, I have my own business

168
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:44,957
with many buddies.

169
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,582
Come with me and stay

170
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:47,958
for the spring festival.

171
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:49,542
Alright.

172
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,708
Deal?

173
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,750
Deal.

174
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:54,667
Alright.

175
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:55,583
Bottoms up!

176
00:12:55,584 --> 00:12:57,042
Cigarettes.

177
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:01,833
Awesome.

178
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:07,958
Watch it.

179
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:10,167
I can't wait anymore.

180
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,750
Sweetheart.

181
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:13,958
Come on.

182
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,167
What are you doing?

183
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,083
Let me go!

184
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,792
Come on.

185
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:21,542
What's wrong with you?

186
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,333
You rascal, let's go home.

187
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,417
You rascal, where are you?

188
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,417
Hello?

189
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,542
Auspiciousness brings a bright future.

190
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:55,958
Great name!

191
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:57,125
I must

192
00:13:57,126 --> 00:13:59,249
redo the paint one day.

193
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,374
I don't want to ruin my bright future.

194
00:14:01,375 --> 00:14:02,457
Very funny.

195
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:03,916
What an honor to have you here

196
00:14:03,917 --> 00:14:05,374
at my rickshaw yard!

197
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,542
Heho, feng.

198
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,207
Shui, be careful up there.

199
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:10,208
Alright.

200
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,624
Young master, how do you say it?

201
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:13,750
It's an "honor"?

202
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:15,333
Yeah, that's right.

203
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:16,917
Feng.

204
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,542
Why are you up so late?

205
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,875
I've been waiting for you.

206
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:25,667
Young master.

207
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:26,708
Let's go.

208
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:28,500
Mind the steps.

209
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,957
Bufeng,

210
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,417
you're doing well.

211
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,792
Thanks.

212
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:35,957
Chan, this is young master,

213
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,167
ip man.

214
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,042
Young master,
this is chan, my sister.

215
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,457
Talk while I get my room

216
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,667
ready for you.

217
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:48,667
Hello, ip man.

218
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,208
Call him young master.

219
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:53,792
Don't listen to him.

220
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:55,083
Call me ip man.

221
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,500
Nice to meet you, chan.

222
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,042
The upper bunk is yours.

223
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:16,667
Alright.

224
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,625
Tomorrow,

225
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,957
young master and I will take you around

226
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,917
to show you the world.

227
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:27,708
That's great!

228
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,500
Let's see paintings and go to malls.

229
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,708
Alright.

230
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:32,603
I hope you don't mind my humble place.

231
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,250
Not at all. It's very nice.

232
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,167
Miss butterfly!

233
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,833
Silly you! What are you doing?

234
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,458
Don't hide it.

235
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,708
I didn't know you were a fan.

236
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,875
It's just for the humidity.

237
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,583
I don't know her.

238
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,874
Alright. It's getting late.

239
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:52,957
Let young master rest.

240
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,624
See you. Let's go.

241
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,125
Young master, see you.

242
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,833
Ip man, thank you for saving us.

243
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,313
- Don't mention it.
- Were you scared?

244
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,875
80 yuan

245
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:17,458
So pricy!

246
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,832
Miss, would you like to be an actress?

247
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,792
A-Actress?

248
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,874
We're talent scouts for a movie company.

249
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:33,249
This is our business card.

250
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,458
Here you are.

251
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,249
Come for an interview when you're free.

252
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,958
We'll pay you.

253
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,291
Chan.

254
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:45,625
Ip man.

255
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,250
Let's go.

256
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,291
Nice paintings.

257
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,292
Yourfnends?

258
00:16:51,293 --> 00:16:52,916
They're talent scouts.

259
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,458
Talent scouts?

260
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,208
Where's my brother?

261
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:58,750
Ice cream.

262
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:00,167
Ice cream incoming.

263
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:01,750
Here, chan, young master,

264
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,042
take it.

265
00:17:03,043 --> 00:17:04,082
Alright.

266
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,083
I just heard

267
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:06,667
that miss butterfly is coming.

268
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,957
Are actresses popular?

269
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:12,917
Of course! They're popular
and they make big money.

270
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,542
Young master...

271
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:17,624
Miss butterfly is here!

272
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:19,082
Miss butterfly! She's here!

273
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,166
Hold it. Hold it. Miss butterfly!

274
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:21,875
Bufeng.

275
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:23,125
Miss butterfly.

276
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,208
Miss butterfly is here!

277
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,083
Miss butterfly!

278
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:28,583
Miss butterfly!

279
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,958
Miss butterfly!

280
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:33,167
Miss butterfly!

281
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,792
Miss butterfly!

282
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,250
Miss butterfly!

283
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:43,541
Even the yellow faces can be stars as well.

284
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:46,750
There are two types of people,

285
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,083
expensive

286
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,708
and cheap.

287
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:54,041
Check it out! Join our movie company

288
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:55,499

289
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,417
Check it out!

290
00:17:56,418 --> 00:17:58,082
Join us to be an actress.

291
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,458
We're talent scouts.

292
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:11,082
How are the new buyers?

293
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,917
They need it in one week.

294
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:20,875
Excuse me.

295
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:22,999
Young master,

296
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,499
even though kung fu helps,

297
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,792
you're carrying too much weight.

298
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,375
Just say that you want to drop me off.

299
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,249
He's using twice the strength

300
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,666
for a single job.

301
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,208
What would you do if you were him?

302
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,288
Madam, don't listen to him.

303
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,375
Young man, you don't
look like a rickshaw man.

304
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,833
He's not!

305
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:43,708
Listen,

306
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,916
this is
my young master serving you.

307
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,833
Shut up. I'm not talking to you.

308
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:51,875
Here we are.

309
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,958
Here.

310
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,375
Alright.

311
00:18:56,292 --> 00:18:57,208
Mind the steps.

312
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:58,667
Okay, thank you.

313
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,000
Young man,

314
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,582
this is my business card.

315
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,916
I'm sis liu.
Come to me for help if needed.

316
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:08,250
I got your back.

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,708
Let me see.

318
00:19:09,709 --> 00:19:10,958
Get lost.

319
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:14,708
Hurry.

320
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,082
Okay, I'm ip man.

321
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,166
Nice to meet you.

322
00:19:18,167 --> 00:19:20,375
See you.

323
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,500
Young master,

324
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,375
only you have that kind of luck.

325
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,708
I'm working for you.

326
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,917
And you're making fun of me!

327
00:19:33,042 --> 00:19:33,833
Are you making fun of me?

328
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:34,958
Are you?

329
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,375
I also know wing chun.

330
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:37,833
S-Stay back.

331
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,542
Let's go.

332
00:19:38,543 --> 00:19:39,667
Go. Go.

333
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,000
Here we go.

334
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,792
Young master, easy.

335
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:47,125
Young master,

336
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:49,292
you should teach us wing chun.

337
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,583
Young master,

338
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,125
let's go.

339
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,417
Quiet!

340
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,207
Young master,

341
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,500
those at the port

342
00:20:15,667 --> 00:20:17,375
work for the British.

343
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:19,250
Don't mess with them.

344
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,375
Or we'll get into trouble.

345
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,667
Let's go.

346
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,208
Young master.

347
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,792
Young master.

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,792
Move.

349
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:41,167
Behave.

350
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:42,999
- Over there.
- Let go!

351
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,750
Over there.

352
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,208
Wait.

353
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,375
Who is that?

354
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,250
Why are they tied up?

355
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,207
Help me.

356
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,499
Quiet.

357
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,791
It is none of your business.

358
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:57,958
Get lost.

359
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,708
Stand up.

360
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:12,667
I'm talking to you.

361
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,375
You asked for it.

362
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,458
Help.

363
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,333
Mr. Liu.

364
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,083
Mr. Liu.

365
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,500
I've been looking for you.

366
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:44,207
Stop fooling around.

367
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,208
Secretary li asked me to get you home.

368
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:47,667
Let's go.

369
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,167
Who are you?

370
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:52,500
I'm the head servant of the liu family.

371
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:55,500
Detective liu is waiting for you at home.

372
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:57,166
Young master, let's go home.

373
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,083
Your dad is the detective?

374
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,208
What? Does he have to
wear a name tag?

375
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:06,750
Young master,

376
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,167
let's go.

377
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:12,083
Help us! Help us!

378
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,666
Help us!

379
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:15,875
Please!

380
00:22:17,792 --> 00:22:18,958
Let them go.

381
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:24,750
Otherwise,

382
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,833
I'll put you all in jail!

383
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,000
Thank you.

384
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:42,750
Drop it.

385
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:43,791
Drop it now!

386
00:22:43,792 --> 00:22:45,083
Drop it.

387
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:49,999
Young master.

388
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,208
The detective's son?

389
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,124
Can you tell me

390
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:04,375
where the detective lives?

391
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,292
Detective...

392
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,500
Let's hear from you.

393
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:27,625
Detective...

394
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:45,250
- Feng.
- Young master.

395
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,125
Are you hungry?

396
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:51,292
Let's end this fast and go for food.

397
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,375
It's on me.

398
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:04,125
Young master.

399
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:27,292
Young master.

400
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,792
The girls are safe. Let's go.

401
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,417
You think the police don't know about this?

402
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,417
I know what you're trying to say.

403
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:57,875
Slow down.

404
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,667
Someone must stand up against injustice.

405
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,292
There are rules to follow in Hong Kong.

406
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,749
We should mind our own business.

407
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,792
Are we still human
if we give up on justice?

408
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,625
We can't give up kindness
and promote evil deeds.

409
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,874
I know those teachings.

410
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,833
But we have to be aware of our status.

411
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:20,375
Those port people...

412
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:22,958
Never mind.

413
00:26:22,959 --> 00:26:25,375
You bookworms are so stubborn.

414
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,707
I'll take sole responsibility.

415
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:31,958
If it bothers you, phleave.

416
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,749
Don't even think about it.

417
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,458
Let's go.

418
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:38,707
I've got something nice for you.

419
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:39,750
Sir.

420
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:41,042
What is it?

421
00:26:41,043 --> 00:26:42,249
I'm not telling you.

422
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,083
You'll find out.

423
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:44,792
Mr. Hu, have some food.

424
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:45,917
Rain check.

425
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:47,291
Young master, let's go.

426
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:49,375
Come on.

427
00:26:53,583 --> 00:26:54,708
Young master,

428
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,625
race you there!

429
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:58,250
Step aside.

430
00:26:58,251 --> 00:26:59,708
You're cheating!

431
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,042
Watch out.

432
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:02,417
Look.

433
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:03,625
Go. You're leading.

434
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,791
Let's go.

435
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,957
Wing chun

436
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,124
is a woman's fist,

437
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,457
but it's so powerful.

438
00:27:10,458 --> 00:27:11,458
Huh?

439
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:12,917
Huh?

440
00:27:14,958 --> 00:27:17,417
It's 10 pounds for one.

441
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:19,624
So,

442
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,208
it's 60 pounds for six.

443
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,208
Find them

444
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:28,292
or I'll sell your families
to make up for it.

445
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:30,125
Do you hear me?

446
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,250
I made it. I made it.

447
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:37,417
Hurry up.

448
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,583
Young master,

449
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:07,792
how about this?

450
00:28:11,292 --> 00:28:12,333
Ip man.

451
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,792
Happy minor spring festival!

452
00:28:15,167 --> 00:28:19,000
Happy minor spring festival!

453
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,625
When did you set this up?

454
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,375
Happy minor spring festival!

455
00:28:24,042 --> 00:28:25,082
Chan,

456
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:27,667
why's the stake dressed up?

457
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,667
I thought it might hurt ip man's hands.

458
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:37,042
Ip man,

459
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:38,458
teach us wing chun!

460
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:40,332
- Yeah.
- Please teach us.

461
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:41,083
Come on.

462
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:42,292
Show us.

463
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,916
Show us, please.

464
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:44,792
You want to learn?

465
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:45,999
Yeah. Ip man.

466
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We do.

467
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:48,417
Show us! Show us!

468
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,875
Let me show you, then.

469
00:28:50,375 --> 00:28:51,208
Come on.

470
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:52,542
Show us.

471
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,707
Wing chun has three forms.

472
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:57,749
Sinking bridge.

473
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,124
Thrusting fingers.

474
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:00,500
Lhheldea.

475
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:39,875
Watch it.

476
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,125
Watch it. It's lit.

477
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:43,667
Sweet dumplings!

478
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:46,083
Come and have sweet dumplings.

479
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:57,249
Chan,

480
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,208
you should be impartial.

481
00:29:58,209 --> 00:29:59,833
Ip man is more worthy.

482
00:30:00,167 --> 00:30:01,999
Stop it,
or I'll teach you a lesson!

483
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,082
- Bah!
- Come here!

484
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,208
- Come here!
- Hey,

485
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:05,167
watch it.

486
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:06,499
Ip man, help.

487
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,250
You're spilling the soup!

488
00:31:40,542 --> 00:31:43,583
A poem dedicated to this bowl of soup.

489
00:31:43,958 --> 00:31:47,083
The kitchen god is
reporting to heaven today.

490
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,542
Please enjoy.

491
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:54,875
Mr. Stark,

492
00:31:55,208 --> 00:31:57,875
you're going wild with your piglet business

493
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,833
by snatching people in public.

494
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:01,457
You're making things

495
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:03,292
really hard for us.

496
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:11,291
You've been doing a good job.

497
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:13,749
And I believe

498
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,583
you'll do even better.

499
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:22,542
I'm afraid the new superintendent
disagrees with you.

500
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:24,500
Are you referring to

501
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,125
superintendent Weston?

502
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:29,416
The governor of Hong Kong
has been concerned about

503
00:32:29,417 --> 00:32:32,082
the disappearance of Chinese recently.

504
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,458
You're paying too little in management fees

505
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,667
to cover oui' expenses.

506
00:32:36,875 --> 00:32:38,416
Superintendent Weston said that

507
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:41,083
if you want to continue doing
business in Hong Kong,

508
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,375
you should show some sincerity.

509
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:46,791
He has felt

510
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:48,792
my sincerity.

511
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,625
Superintendent Weston's ring!

512
00:33:12,167 --> 00:33:13,500
Calm down.

513
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:16,000
Peace makes prosperity.

514
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,875
Let's eat.

515
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,500
I didn't notice how pretty it is.

516
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,167
Look. There.

517
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,458
Chan, isn't it pretty?

518
00:33:28,625 --> 00:33:29,708
Yeah.

519
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:30,916
Ip man,

520
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:32,208
have some water.

521
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,000
- Thanks.
- Feng.

522
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,457
Thanks.

523
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,041
- Chan.
- Listen, bufeng.

524
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:38,666
We've been

525
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,749
so busy with day-to-day life.

526
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,417
Look.

527
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:42,791
Sometimes, we should look

528
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,917
at the sky and the world faraway.

529
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,416
Our ancestors said

530
00:33:47,417 --> 00:33:49,624
that we should be down to earth

531
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,166
and focus on

532
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:52,500
living our lives well.

533
00:33:53,083 --> 00:33:55,667
Our ancestors
were too conservative.

534
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,457
That's why the foreigners

535
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:58,791
have taken over Hong Kong.

536
00:33:58,792 --> 00:34:00,875
We came from over there.

537
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,958
I just want to

538
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,041
provide for my family and friends.

539
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:07,917
I won't seek to cause trouble.

540
00:34:08,292 --> 00:34:09,707
I don't care who's taking over.

541
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:11,167
It's all the same.

542
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:14,667
Is it?

543
00:34:18,292 --> 00:34:19,417
Isn't it?

544
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,042
Iguessitis.

545
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:32,207
How can I miss the clean-up

546
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,583
of the minor spring festival?

547
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:35,583
Honey,

548
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:38,083
what a nice disciple of yours!

549
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:39,333
If he shuns the work,

550
00:34:39,334 --> 00:34:41,083
I won't teach him kung fu.

551
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:45,458
Watch it.

552
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,958
Ip man, give me a hand.

553
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,457
Ouch. Be gentle.

554
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,917
Don't overdo it. Be moderate.

555
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:42,042
Follow the move, not your hands.

556
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:47,791
Use your mind, not your eyes.

557
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:49,332
Practice your hearing.

558
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:50,374
So slow!

559
00:35:50,375 --> 00:35:52,583
Honey, come out and help.

560
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:54,208
Coming.

561
00:35:54,583 --> 00:35:55,625
Master,

562
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:57,500
why are you so afraid of her?

563
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,875
It's called respect.

564
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,208
Yeah, whatever.

565
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:12,708
Newspaper?

566
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:13,792
Sure.

567
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:14,667
Please.

568
00:36:14,668 --> 00:36:16,083
Spare me some coins.

569
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,417
Thank you.

570
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:20,250
Check it out.

571
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,542
Check it out.

572
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,542
Check it out.

573
00:36:27,958 --> 00:36:29,500
Newspapers. Newspapers.

574
00:36:30,708 --> 00:36:32,250
Get a newspaper.

575
00:36:34,042 --> 00:36:35,249
Get a newspaper.

576
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,458
Newspapers.

577
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,042
Feng.

578
00:36:42,043 --> 00:36:43,958
- Are you okay?
- Here.

579
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:45,875
Feng.

580
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:47,749
Feng, are you okay?

581
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:49,583
- You...
- Shui.

582
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,125
Stay back.

583
00:36:57,917 --> 00:36:59,083
This...

584
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:00,708
This is my own business.

585
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:02,750
Stay out of it.

586
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,416
Who the hell are you
trying to be a "hero"?

587
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:06,457
Are you risking your neck?

588
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,457
How many times have I told you

589
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,791
to mind your own business?

590
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,249
I was trying to help.

591
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:11,875
Yeah, right.

592
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:12,957
You weren't helping.

593
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:14,207
You were nothing

594
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:15,417
but a punching bag.

595
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:16,583
Alright. Alright.

596
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:18,208
Go home.

597
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:20,666
What's going on?

598
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:21,750
They're fighting.

599
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,458
Stop it.

600
00:37:33,083 --> 00:37:34,625
Isn't he the rickshaw guy?

601
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:40,792
Now I will pay for one.

602
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:42,250
Shut up.

603
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:53,500
What do you want?

604
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:55,542
Feng.

605
00:37:55,543 --> 00:37:56,875
- Stay back.
- Are you okay?

606
00:37:57,083 --> 00:37:58,625
Stay back.

607
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:00,250
They want money.

608
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:03,874
I did it, not them.

609
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,457
How much do you want?

610
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,583
A thousand pounds.

611
00:38:07,083 --> 00:38:08,375
Do you have the money?

612
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,292
This is blackmail.

613
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:12,708
If not,

614
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,417
you're dead.

615
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,332
That foreigner

616
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,833
is a boxer.

617
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,749
He's using British bartitsu.

618
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,958
What's bartitsu?

619
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:50,041
Mr. Barton-Wright combined

620
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:53,207
boxing, jujutsu, and
wrestling into bartitsu,

621
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:56,167
a martial art practiced
by the British upper class.

622
00:39:21,167 --> 00:39:22,583
Wreck this place.

623
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:37,250
Excuse me.

624
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,625
Feng.

625
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,375
Shui.

626
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:07,917
Let's go.

627
00:41:08,583 --> 00:41:09,750
Let's go.

628
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,042
Shui.

629
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:29,375
Help.

630
00:41:29,376 --> 00:41:30,417
Help!

631
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:31,958
Shui.

632
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:33,583
Come.

633
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,458
Mom, are you okay?

634
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:37,874
Take shui to the hospital.

635
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:38,542
Shui.

636
00:41:38,543 --> 00:41:39,625
Stop!

637
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,542
This is what you get for seeking justice.

638
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:49,667
Look at this.

639
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:55,125
Ip man.

640
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,750
Is this justice?

641
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:58,624
Is this righteousness?

642
00:41:58,625 --> 00:41:59,791
Bufeng,

643
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:00,832
I started this.

644
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,124
I'll take sole responsibility.

645
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:03,125
How?

646
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,333
What can you possibly do?

647
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:12,208
Come, this way.

648
00:42:13,625 --> 00:42:14,708
Feng.

649
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,458
He's looking for you.

650
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,166
Y-Your sister

651
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,250
is in danger!

652
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,417
Stop crying!

653
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:41,792
Another dead.

654
00:44:01,917 --> 00:44:02,957
Liu, liu.

655
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:05,125
Do you remember
the young rickshaw man?

656
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:06,833
Big news!

657
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:09,374
Don't let the news spread.

658
00:44:09,375 --> 00:44:13,958
Extra: British boxer defeated by
wing chun master

659
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:19,042
you didn't find all of them.

660
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:21,583
As long as I found them...

661
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:34,750
Freeze.

662
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:52,167
Let my sister go.

663
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:39,375
I've heard that you're quite the fighter.

664
00:45:40,375 --> 00:45:41,917
I ruined your business.

665
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:43,125
Take me.

666
00:45:43,126 --> 00:45:44,292
Let his sister go.

667
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,417
Okay.

668
00:46:07,792 --> 00:46:09,167
Either he

669
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,292
or your sister dies.

670
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,583
Stop.

671
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:20,041
We should let the Chinese

672
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:22,875
admire the bartitsu of Great Britain.

673
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:30,666
In three days,

674
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:32,500
we'll hold a fight in public.

675
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:34,917
If you win,

676
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:37,625
I'll let her go.

677
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:12,999
Bufeng.

678
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,375
Have faith.

679
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,292
We can save chan for sure!

680
00:48:17,417 --> 00:48:18,708
How?

681
00:48:20,833 --> 00:48:22,167
By beating them.

682
00:48:26,042 --> 00:48:27,542
Thank you, young master.

683
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:38,500
It's cold.

684
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,832
Let's go home.

685
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:16,833
Your mom is waiting.

686
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,917
Go tell her the news.

687
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,666
I'm getting some medicine for my buddies.

688
00:49:24,667 --> 00:49:25,625
Okay.

689
00:49:25,626 --> 00:49:27,375
The bill, please.

690
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,083
Bufeng.

691
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,708
Let me chip in.

692
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:54,042
See you.

693
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:04,708
I know

694
00:50:05,042 --> 00:50:06,625
that it's our fault.

695
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,042
I promise

696
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:11,542
I'll pay you back.

697
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,167
Please let us off.

698
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:25,000
I have savings.

699
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:27,958
It may not be enough.

700
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,542
I also have a business.

701
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:33,375
I can give you everything.

702
00:50:35,167 --> 00:50:36,208
Please

703
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:38,292
let us off.

704
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,292
Enough.

705
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:38,750
It's not about money anymore.

706
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:43,208
To know oneself is true knowledge.

707
00:51:55,583 --> 00:51:58,708
You know what I want.

708
00:52:04,292 --> 00:52:05,667
Okay.

709
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:09,125
My promise is under one condition.

710
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,667
Let ip man off

711
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:14,875
as well.

712
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:20,583
Mr. Stark,

713
00:52:20,584 --> 00:52:22,875
what made you launch this contest?

714
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:26,749
Some people have said

715
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:28,624
that British bartitsu

716
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:31,874
is no match for Chinese wing chun.

717
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:35,250
I must prove that it's a misunderstanding.

718
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:38,207
Master,

719
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,625
look at this.

720
00:52:42,458 --> 00:52:43,874
You must remember

721
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:46,667
to hold your camera real tight.

722
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,749
I'm afraid I'll win so fast

723
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,250
you won't even get to click the shutter.

724
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:54,833
Wing chun against bartitsu?

725
00:52:59,458 --> 00:53:00,707
News! News!

726
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:02,666
Wing chun against bartitsu!

727
00:53:02,667 --> 00:53:03,916
News! News!

728
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:05,375
Get a newspaper.

729
00:53:05,583 --> 00:53:06,500
Check it out.

730
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,375
Guys.

731
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:08,208
Here.

732
00:53:08,209 --> 00:53:10,208
Wing chun against bartitsu.

733
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:11,916
That'd be interesting.

734
00:53:11,917 --> 00:53:13,292
Not necessarily.

735
00:53:37,625 --> 00:53:38,958
This contest

736
00:53:39,208 --> 00:53:43,500
between bartitsu and wing chun

737
00:53:43,792 --> 00:53:47,083
is a friendly exchange.

738
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:49,457
This contest

739
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:53,041
between bartitsu and wing chun

740
00:53:53,042 --> 00:53:55,375
is friendly communication.

741
00:53:58,792 --> 00:54:00,082
Whoever

742
00:54:00,083 --> 00:54:01,792
gets off the stage

743
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:03,125
of

744
00:54:03,126 --> 00:54:05,333
Pounds on the ground three times

745
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:07,042
loses.

746
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:09,500
Just surrender if you can't

747
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:10,750
take it.

748
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,625
We'll find another way to save chan.

749
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,625
I got this.

750
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:19,208
The contest

751
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:20,749
may lead to death

752
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,083
or injury.

753
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:23,791
No one

754
00:54:23,792 --> 00:54:25,332
shall take

755
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:27,208
any legal responsibilities.

756
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:28,917
It's quite hot.

757
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,083
Wipe your sweat.

758
00:54:30,084 --> 00:54:32,166
The contest may lead to death or injury.

759
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:35,125
No one shall
take any legal responsibilities.

760
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,416
I hereby announce that

761
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:40,457
the contest between wing chun and bartitsu

762
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:41,750
starts now!

763
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,125
Yeah!

764
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,042
Yeah!

765
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:53,957
Yeah!

766
00:54:53,958 --> 00:55:00,542
Ip man! Ip man!

767
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:03,292
Bartitsu!

768
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:42,333
Wing chun, ip man.

769
00:56:08,375 --> 00:56:09,708
This is not good.

770
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:39,083
Bravo! Bravo!

771
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:39,958
- Bravo!
- Not bad.

772
00:56:39,959 --> 00:56:41,208
Well done!

773
00:56:41,583 --> 00:56:43,292
Well done!

774
00:56:49,583 --> 00:56:50,833
Sit tight.

775
00:57:06,458 --> 00:57:07,125
Master ip, what's wrong?

776
00:57:07,126 --> 00:57:08,166
Don't push it.

777
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:09,167
Look.

778
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:10,999
Something's wrong.

779
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,083
No. Rest assured.

780
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:16,832
There's something wrong with master ip.

781
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:17,833
Yeah.

782
00:57:30,375 --> 00:57:31,667
Bravo!

783
00:57:32,542 --> 00:57:35,083
Get up, master ip.

784
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:37,708
Get up, master ip.

785
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,875
Young master, stop it.

786
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:40,833
Master ip.

787
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:41,583
Young master.

788
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,292
Get up.

789
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:45,417
Master ip. Master ip.

790
00:57:45,917 --> 00:57:50,333
Master ip. Get up.

791
00:57:53,333 --> 00:57:54,667
Stop it, young master.

792
00:57:54,917 --> 00:57:56,375
Master ip.

793
00:57:56,583 --> 00:57:59,791
Come on, master ip! Get up!

794
00:57:59,792 --> 00:58:01,875
Fight him!

795
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,333
Bartitsu!

796
00:58:05,208 --> 00:58:06,333
Stop!

797
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,208
Just stop!

798
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,542
Young master!

799
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:15,708
Yeah!

800
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:16,958
That's the spirit!

801
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,208
Kill him!

802
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:53,958
You're here!

803
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:23,333
Host,

804
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:24,541
we give in!

805
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:25,832
Stop it now, please!

806
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:27,000
We give in!

807
00:59:45,667 --> 00:59:47,417
Stand up!

808
00:59:51,417 --> 00:59:52,874
Come on!

809
00:59:52,875 --> 00:59:54,042
Master ip!

810
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:02,167
Young master.

811
01:00:02,667 --> 01:00:04,417
We give in!

812
01:00:04,917 --> 01:00:06,458
We are done fighting!

813
01:00:07,792 --> 01:00:08,875
Young master!

814
01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:11,167
Get up!

815
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:13,207
Get up, ip man!

816
01:00:13,208 --> 01:00:15,041
Come one, ip man!

817
01:00:15,042 --> 01:00:18,833
Ip man, get up!

818
01:00:23,875 --> 01:00:24,958
Hello, ip man.

819
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:26,958
We can save chan for sure!

820
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,667
Ip man, help.

821
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,457
Young master, this is all my fault!

822
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:33,750
It's my fault!

823
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,750
Young master!

824
01:00:47,792 --> 01:00:48,792
Young master!

825
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:51,166
Young master, please! Stop now!

826
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:53,375
Do not continue!

827
01:00:55,667 --> 01:00:57,541
There you go! Get up!

828
01:00:57,542 --> 01:00:59,125
Get up, ip man.

829
01:00:59,667 --> 01:01:02,332
Young master!

830
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:04,625
Ip man! Ip man!

831
01:01:05,708 --> 01:01:07,167
There you go!

832
01:01:08,167 --> 01:01:13,250
Ip man! Ip man! Ip man!

833
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:18,957
Ip man! Ip man!

834
01:01:18,958 --> 01:01:20,083
Yeah!

835
01:01:21,333 --> 01:01:22,250
That's the spirit!

836
01:01:22,251 --> 01:01:24,167
There you go, ip man!

837
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:43,917
Follow the move, not your hands.
Use your mind, not your eyes.

838
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:28,250
Ip man, hit him! Hit him!

839
01:02:29,958 --> 01:02:37,958
Ip man! Ip man! Ip man!

840
01:02:48,875 --> 01:02:52,458
We won!

841
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:56,292
He did it! We won!

842
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,208
Nice win, master ip!

843
01:03:02,209 --> 01:03:03,292
Hooray!

844
01:03:04,583 --> 01:03:06,541
Great! We won!

845
01:03:06,542 --> 01:03:08,458
Ip man!

846
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:10,958
Yes! We won!

847
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:13,167
Yeah!

848
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:24,875
Bufeng!

849
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:29,375
Bufeng!

850
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,083
Control the fire!

851
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,166
Bufeng! Bufeng! Bufeng!

852
01:04:41,167 --> 01:04:42,667
Man!

853
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:44,250
Master!

854
01:04:44,251 --> 01:04:45,583
Where is bufeng?

855
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,916
- Move!
- Move aside!

856
01:04:50,917 --> 01:04:52,417
Move! Move!

857
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:53,875
What is it?

858
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:55,042
They are here.

859
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,208
What...

860
01:04:58,917 --> 01:05:00,167
Move aside! Move!

861
01:05:00,833 --> 01:05:02,083
Get lost!

862
01:05:02,875 --> 01:05:04,042
Have you seen this guy?

863
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,083
Find him!

864
01:05:07,084 --> 01:05:08,250
Go go go!

865
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:11,707
Over there!

866
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:12,708
Quick!

867
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:13,708
Move aside!

868
01:05:13,917 --> 01:05:14,917
Move!

869
01:05:15,333 --> 01:05:16,542
Move!

870
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,333
What are you doing?

871
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,083
Go go!

872
01:05:29,417 --> 01:05:30,500
Amen!

873
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:36,542
Let's go.

874
01:05:41,083 --> 01:05:41,750
Over there!

875
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:43,000
Quick!

876
01:05:57,917 --> 01:05:59,874
Get them!

877
01:05:59,875 --> 01:06:00,875
They are on the run!

878
01:06:01,208 --> 01:06:02,292
Go get him!

879
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:14,083
Master,

880
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,667
is this my fault?

881
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,250
If asking for justice is wrong,

882
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:23,833
then this world would be hopeless.

883
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,750
Righteousness

884
01:06:28,042 --> 01:06:29,375
can be either forgotten

885
01:06:29,917 --> 01:06:31,750
or awakened.

886
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:34,667
Forgetting is easy,

887
01:06:35,958 --> 01:06:37,250
but

888
01:06:37,917 --> 01:06:39,249
for awakening,

889
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,750
that's where you always pay the price.

890
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,875
Chinese kung fu

891
01:06:49,625 --> 01:06:51,667
is not just about the moves.

892
01:06:52,167 --> 01:06:53,374
It contains

893
01:06:53,375 --> 01:06:56,208
the wisdom and spirit of Chinese culture.

894
01:06:56,958 --> 01:06:59,875
You have learned the spirit of justice,

895
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:02,958
but pleading for justice

896
01:07:03,417 --> 01:07:05,958
requires good timing and chance.

897
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:07,999
Moreover,

898
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,708
wisdom and resourcefulness are needed.

899
01:08:25,750 --> 01:08:26,917
Feet!

900
01:08:27,542 --> 01:08:28,792
Feet!

901
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:18,375
Rickshaw yard mystery explosion

902
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:51,625
To my dearest master,

903
01:09:52,750 --> 01:09:56,458
what happened recently is all my fault.

904
01:09:58,167 --> 01:10:00,292
My actions were definitely not wise.

905
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,000
As you have said before,

906
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:08,041
asking for justice and
awakening righteousness

907
01:10:08,042 --> 01:10:11,250
require wisdom and resourcefulness.

908
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:13,082
I, man,

909
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:14,875
shall heed your words.

910
01:10:15,875 --> 01:10:18,583
I have decided to go save the others.

911
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,708
Master, please do not worry about me.

912
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:23,166
A true warrior

913
01:10:23,167 --> 01:10:25,041
shall have both wisdom and bravery,

914
01:10:25,042 --> 01:10:27,083
and let his spirit last long.

915
01:10:28,292 --> 01:10:29,417
Ip man

916
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,583
Ms. Liu, this is ip man.

917
01:10:55,167 --> 01:10:56,542
We are all Chinese.

918
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,125
I don't want to hurt you.

919
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:08,207
You are the first Chinese

920
01:13:08,208 --> 01:13:10,000
who dares to confront me.

921
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,708
And you will be the last.

922
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:36,917
Ip man!

923
01:15:16,917 --> 01:15:17,917
Go on, go!

924
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:19,850
What are you looking at?
Behave yourself!

925
01:15:20,418 --> 01:15:22,833
Speed up!

926
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,374
Ms. Liu, this is ip man.

927
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:42,207
Ip man, you are awesome.

928
01:15:42,208 --> 01:15:43,249
Move move move!

929
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:44,875
Maybe you are trustworthy.

930
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:47,374
The British have been selling our people

931
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,042
at dock bb.

932
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:51,500
That place was run by the British.

933
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:52,833
That's right.

934
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:53,833
This is a tough situation.

935
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:54,625
Yeah, I know that.

936
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:55,417
Breaking news! Breaking news!

937
01:15:55,418 --> 01:15:57,500
No other papers will
dare to report this piece!

938
01:15:57,833 --> 01:15:59,500
I wonder if you can work this out.

939
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:04,041
Give back our Liberty!

940
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:07,166
All men are created equal!

941
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:10,707
Give back our Liberty!

942
01:16:10,708 --> 01:16:13,791
No violence!

943
01:16:13,792 --> 01:16:16,582
No oppression!

944
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:20,917
No hegemonism!

945
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,291
We will thoroughly investigate
the dock and evil forces,

946
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,750
and return the truth to the people.

947
01:16:32,167 --> 01:16:34,124
Police are investigating
the human trafficking case

948
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:38,375
rickshaw yard caught on fire

949
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:46,833
Master, this way.

950
01:16:47,042 --> 01:16:48,768
What a bustling day!
People are waiting for you!

951
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:50,041
Young master,
join us for the ribbon-cutting later!

952
01:16:50,042 --> 01:16:50,708
Sure.

953
01:16:50,709 --> 01:16:52,500
Chan, mom! Come on!

954
01:16:54,292 --> 01:16:55,666
Here, here!

955
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:56,667
Here!

956
01:16:56,875 --> 01:16:57,667
Get around!

957
01:16:57,708 --> 01:16:58,957
Come one, let's cut the ribbon together.

958
01:16:58,958 --> 01:16:59,833
Come here, master!

959
01:16:59,834 --> 01:17:01,083
Come out!

960
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,583
Okay.

961
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:15,833
Ms. Liu,

962
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:18,292
how did you manage
to get people to the dock?

963
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:22,027
I told them that miss butterfly was there,
shooting a movie.
